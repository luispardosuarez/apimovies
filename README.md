# Movies API Project

This project is part of an assignment undertaken at Factor√≠a F5 during the bootcamp. The primary goal was to develop a RESTful API incorporating all the fundamental CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE). Additionally, the task required establishing One-to-Many and Many-to-Many relationships between tables.

An extra objective involved creating a sixth endpoint, distinct from the standard getAll, getById, post, update, and delete functionalities. This additional endpoint facilitates retrieving a movie by its title.

The project is implemented using the Spring framework and managed with Maven.
